## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-09

This release changes the way the core handles contact keys.
Instead of tracking OpenPGP keys corresponding to the
contacts in [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org/) peerstate,
the core creates a new "key-contact" for each known public key.
Reception of a message signed with a new unknown key
no longer results in warnings about setup changes,
but creates a new contact and a new 1:1 chat if necessary.
Additionally, there are "address-contacts" corresponding
to the e-mail addresses.

### Features / Changes

- Wait for scheduler tasks shutdown in parallel.
- Update deltachat-repl help and autocomplete to match implementation ([#6978](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/6978), ([#6979](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/6979)).

- Treat and send images that can't be decoded as Viewtype::File.
- Decide on filename used for sending depending on the original Viewtype.
- Migrate_key_contacts(): Remove "id>9" from encrypted messages SELECT.

- `Chat::send_msg`: Remove encryption-related params from already sent message. This allows to send received encrypted `dc_msg_t` object to unencrypted chat, e.g. in a Python bot.
- Set message download state to Failure on IMAP errors. This avoids partially downloaded messages getting stuck in "Downloading..." state without actually being in a download queue.
- BCC-to-self even if server deletion is set to "at once". This is a workaround for SMTP servers which do not return response in time, BCC-self works as a confirmation that message was sent out successfully and does not need more retries.
- node: Run tests with native ESM modules instead of `esm` ([#5194](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5194)).
- Use Quoted-Printable MIME encoding for the text part ([#3986](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/3986)).

### Tests

- python: Add `get_protected_chat` to testplugin.py.

## [1.133.0] - 2024-01-14

### Features / Changes

- Securejoin protocol implementation refinements
  - Track forward and backward verification separately ([#5089](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5089)) to avoid inconsistent states.
  - Mark 1:1 chat as verified for Bob early. 1:1 chat with Alice is verified as soon as Alice's key is verified rather than at the end of the protocol.
- Put Message-ID into hidden headers and take it from there on receiver ([#4798](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/4798)). This works around servers which generate their own Message-ID and overwrite the one generated by Delta Chat.
- deltachat-repl: Enable INFO logging by default and add timestamps.
- Add `ConfigSynced` (`DC_EVENT_CONFIG_SYNCED`) event which is emitted when configuration is changed via synchronization message or synchronization message for configuration is sent. UI may refresh elements based on the configuration key which is a part of the event.
- Sync contact creation/rename across devices ([#5163](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5163)).
- Encrypt MDNs ([#5175](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5175)).

- Restore "Constants" page in Doxygen >=1.9.8

### Fixes

- imap: Limit the rate of LOGIN attempts rather than connection attempts. This is to avoid having to wait for rate limiter right after switching from a bad or offline network to a working network while still guarding against reconnection loop.
- Do not ignore `peerstate.save_to_db()` errors.
- securejoin: Mark 1:1s as protected regardless of the Config::VerifiedOneOnOneChats.
- Delete received outgoing messages from SMTP queue ([#5115](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5115)).
- imap: Fail fast on `LIST` errors to avoid busy loop when connection is lost.
- Split SMTP jobs already in `chat::create_send_msg_jobs()` ([#5115](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5115)).
- Do not remove contents from unencrypted [Schleuder](https://schleuder.org/) mailing lists messages.
- Reset message error when scheduling resending ([#5119](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5119)).
- Emit events more reliably when starting and stopping I/O ([#5101](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5101)).
- Fix timestamp of chat protection info message for correct message ordering after restoring a backup ([#5088](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/5088)).

### API-Changes

- [**breaking**] Return `DC_CONTACT_ID_SELF` from `dc_contact_get_verifier_id()` for directly verified contacts.
- Deprecate `dc_contact_get_verifier_addr`.
- python: use `dc_contact_get_verifier_id()`. `get_verifier()` returns a Contact rather than an address now.
- Deprecate `get_next_media()`.
- Ignore public key argument in `dc_preconfigure_keypair()`. Public key is extracted from the private key.

### Fixes

- Wrap base64-encoded parts to 76 characters.

- Do not trash messages with attachments and no text when `location.kml` is attached ([#4749](https://github.com/chatmail/core/issues/4749)).
- Initialise `last_msg_id` to the highest known row id. This ensures bots migrated from older version to `dc_get_next_msgs()` API do not process all previous messages from scratch.
- Do not put the status footer into reaction MIME parts.
- Ignore special chats in `get_similar_chat_ids()`. This prevents trash chat from showing up in similar chat list ([#4756](https://github.com/chatmail/core/issues/4756)).
- Cap percentage in connectivity layout to 100% ([#4765](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/4765)).
- Add Let's Encrypt root certificate to `reqwest`. This should allow scanning `DCACCOUNT` QR-codes on older Android phones when the server has a Let's Encrypt certificate.
- deltachat-rpc-client: Increase stdio buffer to 64 MiB to avoid Python bots crashing when trying to load large messages via a JSON-RPC call.
- Add `protected-headers` directive to Content-Type of encrypted messages with attachments ([#2302](https://github.com/chatmail/core/issues/2302)). This makes Thunderbird show encrypted Subject for Delta Chat messages.
- webxdc: Reset `document.update` on forwarding. This fixes the test `test_forward_webxdc_instance()`.

### Features / Changes

## [1.117.0] - 2023-06-15

### Features

- New group membership update algorithm.

  New algorithm improves group consistency
  in cases of missing messages,
  restored old backups and replies from classic MUAs.

- Add `DC_EVENT_MSG_DELETED` event.

  This event notifies the UI about the message
  being deleted from the messagelist, e.g. when the message expires
  or the user deletes it.

### Fixes

- Emit `DC_EVENT_MSGS_CHANGED` without IDs when the message expires.

  Specifying msg IDs that cannot be loaded in the event payload
  results in an error when the UI tries to load the message.
  Instead, emit an event without IDs
  to make the UI reload the whole messagelist.

- Ignore address case when comparing the `To:` field to `Autocrypt-Gossip:`.

  This bug resulted in failure to propagate verification
  if the contact list already contained a new verified group member
  with a non-lowercase address.

- dehtml: skip links with empty text.

  Links like `<a href="https://delta.chat/"></a>` in HTML mails are now skipped
  instead of being converted to a link without a label like `[](https://delta.chat/)`.

- dehtml: Do not insert unnecessary newlines when parsing `<p>` tags.

- Update from yanked `libc` 0.2.145 to 0.2.146.
- Update to async-imap 0.9.0 to remove deprecated `ouroboros` dependency.

### API-Changes

- Emit `DC_EVENT_MSGS_CHANGED` per chat when messages are deleted.

  Previously a single event with zero chat ID was emitted.

- python: make `Contact.is_verified()` return bool.

- rust: add API endpoint `get_status_update` ([#4468](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/4468)).

- rust: make `WebxdcManifest` type public.

### Build system

### Changes

- Improve SMTP logging.

## [1.114.0] - 2023-04-24

### Changes
- JSON-RPC: Use long polling instead of server-sent notifications to retrieve events.
  This better corresponds to JSON-RPC 2.0 server-client distinction
  and is expected to simplify writing new bindings
  because dispatching events can be done on higher level.
- JSON-RPC: TS: Client now has a mandatory argument whether you want to start listening for events.

### Fixes
- JSON-RPC: do not print to stdout on failure to find an account.


## [1.113.0] - 2023-04-18

## [1.112.2] - 2023-03-30

### Changes
- Update iroh, remove `default-net` from `[patch.crates-io]` section.
- transfer backup: Connect to multiple provider addresses concurrently.  This should speed up connection time significantly on the getter side.  #4240
- Make sure BackupProvider is canceled on drop (or `dc_backup_provider_unref`).  The BackupProvider will now always finish with an IMEX event of 1000 or 0, previously it would sometimes finished with 1000 (success) when it really was 0 (failure). #4242

### API Changes

- breaking change: removed deaddrop chat #2514 #2563

  Contact request chats are not merged into a single virtual
  "deaddrop" chat anymore. Instead, they are shown in the chatlist the
  same way as other chats, but sending of messages to them is not
  allowed and MDNs are not sent automatically until the chat is
  "accepted" by the user.

  New API:
  - `dc_chat_is_contact_request()`: returns true if chat is a contact
    request.  In this case an option to accept the chat via
    `dc_accept_chat()` should be shown in the UI.
  - `dc_accept_chat()`: unblock the chat or accept contact request
  - `dc_block_chat()`: block the chat, currently works only for mailing
    lists.

  Removed API:
  - `dc_create_chat_by_msg_id()`: deprecated 2021-02-07 in favor of
    `dc_decide_on_contact_request()`
  - `dc_marknoticed_contact()`: deprecated 2021-02-07 in favor of
    `dc_decide_on_contact_request()`
  - `dc_decide_on_contact_request()`: this call requires a message ID
    from deaddrop chat as input. As deaddrop chat is removed, this
    call can't be used anymore.
  - `dc_msg_get_real_chat_id()`: use `dc_msg_get_chat_id()` instead, the
    only difference between these calls was in handling of deaddrop
    chat
  - removed `DC_CHAT_ID_DEADDROP` and `DC_STR_DEADDROP` constants

- breaking change: removed `DC_EVENT_ERROR_NETWORK` and `DC_STR_SERVER_RESPONSE`
  Instead, there is a new api `dc_get_connectivity()`
  and `dc_get_connectivity_html()`;
  `DC_EVENT_CONNECTIVITY_CHANGED` is emitted on changes

- breaking change: removed `dc_accounts_import_account()`
  Instead you need to add an account and call `dc_imex(DC_IMEX_IMPORT_BACKUP)`
  on its context

- update account api, 2 new methods:
  `int dc_all_work_done (dc_context_t* context);`
  `int dc_accounts_all_work_done (dc_accounts_t* accounts);`

- add api to check if a message was `Auto-Submitted`
  cffi: `int dc_msg_is_bot (const dc_msg_t* msg);`
  python: `Message.is_bot()`

- `dc_context_t* dc_accounts_get_selected_account (dc_accounts_t* accounts);`
  now returns `NULL` if there is no selected account

- added `dc_accounts_maybe_network_lost()` for systems core cannot find out
  connectivity loss on its own (eg. iOS) #2550

### Added
- use Auto-Submitted: auto-generated header to identify bots #2502
- allow sending stickers via repl tool
- chat: make `get_msg_cnt()` and `get_fresh_msg_cnt()` work for deaddrop chat #2493

  crate from @dignifiedquire. thanks @link2xt. 

- introduce per-contact profile images to send out 
  own profile image heuristically, and fix sending
  out of profile images in "in-prepare" groups. 
  this also extends the Chat-spec that is maintained
  in core to specify Chat-Group-Image and Chat-Group-Avatar
  headers. thanks @r10s and @hpk42.

- fix merging of protected headers from the encrypted
  to the unencrypted parts, now not happening recursively
  anymore.  thanks @hpk and @r10s

  sent when there are more than 2 people in a chat. 
  thanks @link2xt

  attachments again.  Fixes usage for simplebot which sends html
  files for users to interact with the bot. @adbenitez @hpk42 

- refinements to internal autocrypt-handling code, do not send
  prefer-encrypt=nopreference as it is the default if no attribute
  is present.  @linkxt 

- simplify, modularize and rustify several parts 
  of dc-core (general WIP). @link2xt @flub @hpk42 @r10s

- use async-email/async-smtp to handle SMTP connections, might
  fix connection/reconnection issues. @link2xt

  @dignifiedquire . 

## 1.0.0-beta.9

- historic: we now use the mailparse crate and lettre-email to generate mime
  messages.  This got rid of mmime completely, the C2rust generated port of the libetpan 
  mime-parse -- IOW 22KLocs of cumbersome code removed! see 
  https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/904#issuecomment-561163330
  many thanks @dignifiedquire for making everybody's life easier 
  and @jonhoo (from rust-imap fame) for suggesting to use the mailparse crate :) 

- lots of improvements and better error handling in many rust modules 
  thanks @link2xt @flub @r10s, @hpk42 and @dignifiedquire 

- @r10s introduced a new device chat which has an initial
  welcome message.  See

- many little fixes and rustifications (@link2xt, @flub, @hpk42)


## 1.0.0-beta.8

- now uses async-email/async-imap as the new base 
  which makes imap-idle interruptible and thus fixes
  several issues around the imap thread being in zombie state . 
  thanks @dignifiedquire, @hpk42 and @link2xt. 

- fixes imap-protocol parsing bugs that lead to infinitely
  repeated crashing while trying to receive messages with
  a subject that contained non-utf8. thanks @link2xt

- fixed logic to find encryption subkey -- previously 
  delta chat would use the primary key for encryption
  (which works with RSA but not ECC). thanks @link2xt

- introduce a new device chat where core and UIs can 
  add "device" messages.  Android uses it for an initial
  welcome message. thanks @r10s

- fix time smearing (when two message are virtually send
  in the same second, there would be misbehaviour because
  we didn't persist smeared time). thanks @r10s

- fix double-dotted extensions like .html.zip or .tar.gz  
  to not mangle them when creating blobfiles.  thanks @flub

- fix backup/exports where the wrong sql file would be modified,
  leading to problems when exporting twice.  thanks @hpk42

  https://c.delta.chat 

- New events ImapMessageMoved and ImapMessageDeleted
