//! OPFS persistence for the wasm core (M5).
//!
//! Two independent pieces, both switched on by [`enable_persistence`]:
//!
//! 1. **SQLite → OPFS**: installs the `opfs-sahpool` VFS from `sqlite-wasm-vfs`
//!    as the *default* sqlite VFS, so every database rusqlite opens lands in
//!    OPFS under `.opfs-sahpool/.opaque/*` (opaque pool files with the real
//!    path embedded in a header). DB files never touch the memfs, so there is
//!    no double storage. The flip side: a memfs subtree removal cannot free a
//!    db's pool slot — that is done separately, keyed by the pool's logical
//!    *filenames* (see [`purge_pool_files_under`] and the boot orphan sweep in
//!    [`enable_persistence`]), which is why the "never touch the memfs"
//!    invariant still holds even though removal now reaches into the pool.
//! 2. **memfs → OPFS mirror**: the in-memory fs is hydrated from the OPFS
//!    directory `memfs/` at startup, and every mutation is written through
//!    asynchronously by a single FIFO flusher task (single-threaded worker,
//!    no races). Dirty paths are deduplicated and the *current* memfs state
//!    is snapshotted at flush time, so the mirror converges to last-state.
//!
//! Also hosts the sqlite VFS byte-level import/export helpers the patched
//! core uses for backup IMEX; they dispatch to whichever VFS is the default
//! (sahpool when persistence is on, the memory VFS otherwise).
